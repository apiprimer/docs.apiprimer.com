You can follow through the documentations and self learn the concepts, else you can enroll on this workshop and get benefited from the explanations and tutoring where there is a clarity required. 

You can also join my [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/campus2corpc2c/shared_invite/zt-28ll0levk-9_Zbo8rM0b8MjKNJwyVxSA) channel and post your queries and get clarifications.
