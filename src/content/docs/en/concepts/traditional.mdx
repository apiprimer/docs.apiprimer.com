Traditional SDLC development is a sequential process that follows a set of well-defined steps. These steps typically include:

1. **Requirements gathering and analysis**: This step involves gathering and analyzing the requirements of the software system from the users and stakeholders.
2. **Design**: This step involves designing the architecture and components of the software system.
3. **Development**: This step involves developing the software system according to the design.
4. **Testing**: This step involves testing the software system to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free of defects.
5. **Deployment**: This step involves deploying the software system to the production environment.
6. **Maintenance**: This step involves maintaining the software system after it has been deployed.

:::note
Traditional SDLC development is a well-established and proven process, but it can be slow and inflexible. It is also difficult to make changes to the requirements of the software system once the development process has begun.
