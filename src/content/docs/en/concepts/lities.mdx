The term "lities" is often used to describe the non-functional requirements or quality attributes of software systems. These qualities are typically related to the performance, usability, security, reliability, and maintainability of the system.

Here is a list of some of the most important lities in software architecture:

**Performance**: Performance refers to the speed, responsiveness, and throughput of a software system. It is typically measured in terms of metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization.

**Usability**: Usability refers to the ease of use of a software system. It is typically measured in terms of metrics such as learnability, efficiency, memorability, error prevention, and satisfaction.

**Security**: Security refers to the protection of a software system from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction. It is typically measured in terms of metrics such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation.

**Reliability**: Reliability refers to the ability of a software system to perform its intended function correctly and consistently over time. It is typically measured in terms of metrics such as fault tolerance, mean time to failure (MTF), and mean time between failures (MTBF).

**Maintainability**: Maintainability refers to the ease of modifying a software system to fix bugs, add new features, or adapt to changing requirements. It is typically measured in terms of metrics such as modularity, understandability, changeability, and testability.

**Scalability**: The ability of a software system to handle increasing workloads or data volumes without significant performance degradation.

**Portability**: The ability of a software system to run on different hardware and software platforms.

**Interoperability**: The ability of a software system to communicate and exchange data with other systems.

**Extensibility**: The ability of a software system to be extended with new features or functionality.

**Flexibility**: The ability of a software system to adapt to changing requirements.

:::note
These lities are not mutually exclusive, and there is often a trade-off between them. For example, a highly secure system may be less performant, or a highly scalable system may be less maintainable.
