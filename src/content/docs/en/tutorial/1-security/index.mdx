Now that you know what you're going to build, it's time to set up all the tools you'll need! 

This unit shows you how to set up security best practices for your cloud account, including creating a new user, roles, policies and groups.

## What you will do?

- Create a new user with least privilege access.
- Use a default ViewOnlyAccess policy for the user.
- Create a group and assign policies to the group.
- Add the user to the group.
