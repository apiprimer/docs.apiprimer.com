Now that you have set up security for your cloud account, it's time to configure networking to enable communication between your resources and the internet.

## What you will do?

- Create a new VPC with public and private subnets.
- Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC.
- Create Route Tables and associate them with the subnets.
- View Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs).
