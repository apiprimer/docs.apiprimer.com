To create an internet gateway, follow these steps:

1. Open the Amazon VPC console.
2. In the navigation pane, click Internet Gateways.
3. Click `Create internet gateway`
4. Provide a name to the gateway `my-igw`
5. Once created this needs to be attached to VPC. Click on the `my-igw` and it will show you the details. 
6. On right top corner Actions -> Attach to VPC

7. Select the VPC `myvpc` and click `Attach internet gateway`

:::note
Generally, you only need one internet gateway for each VPC. An internet gateway is a highly available and scalable component that allows you to route traffic between your VPC and the internet.

## Viewing Routing Tables

1. Open the Amazon VPC console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).
2. In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables.
3. Select the VPC for which you want to view routing tables.
4. The routing tables for the selected VPC will be displayed in a list.
5. Click on the name of a routing table to view its details.

:::note
This table shows a destination `172.31.0.0/16` and target local - meaning that any traffic goes to this IP range will be routed locally within the VPC.

`0.0.0.0/0` meaning that any other IP outside that range will be routed to Internet Gateway from which the traffic will be passed out to the internet

## Editing Routing Table

1. Open the Amazon VPC console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).
2. In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables.
3. Select the VPC `myvpc` for which you want to view routing tables.
4. The routing tables for `myvpc` will be displayed in a list.
5. Click on the name of a routing table to view its details.
6. To make the subnet associated with this routing table to access the internet, you need to add a new route as below,

7. Click "Save Changes" and now the subnet is public subnet
