<summary>How do I use the checklists at the bottom of each page?</summary>

You check them off!

At the end of each page, you'll find a clickable checklist of tasks you should now be able to do. Check these items off to see your progress in the Tutorial Tracker.

Using the tracker is optional, but it can help you remember your place if you complete the tutorial over multiple visits. You can also leave some checklists blank as a reminder of units that you want to revisit later.
