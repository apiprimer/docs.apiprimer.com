## Creating an Amazon EC2 instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console ([https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/]).
2. In the navigation pane, choose **"Instances"** and click **Launch Instances**
3. Provide a name for the ec2 instance `my-instance`
4. An AMI is a template that contains the configuration for an EC2 instance. AMIs include the operating system, applications, and other software that will be installed on the instance. Select `Amazon Linux 2023 AMI`
5. An instance type defines the hardware configuration of the EC2 instance, including the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and storage capacity. Select `t2.micro` - which has capacity of 1 vCPU and 1G RAM
6. Create a **Keypair** which will used when you want to connect to this instance via command line. `my-keypair`. Keypair is nothing but a public/private key where public key is deployed in EC2 instance and if you or anyone wants to connect should provide the private key to connect to instance. 
7. In the Network Settings, click **Edit** and choose the VPC `myvpc` and Subnet `mypublicsubnet` which you have already created. Change the **Auto Assign Public IP** to Enable
8. For **Firewall (Security Group)**, choose the **Create security group** and provide a name `ssh-access`.

:::tip[Note]
If you would like your VMs to be not opened to entire world to see, since it will have a public ip created. In order to connect via EC2 Instance Connect you need to allow the `13.233.177.0/29` IPs as source on port 22 for ap-south-1 region - this IP changes for each region.

```sh
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-02a2af70a66af6dfb --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name my-keypair --security-group-ids sg-0af660089ac5c7ab2 --subnet-id subnet-07ca6b02f2e67d507
```
