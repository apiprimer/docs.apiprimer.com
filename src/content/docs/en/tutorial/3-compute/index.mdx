Now that you have secured and prepared your cloud account, it's time to set up compute resources to run your applications or payloads.

This unit shows you how to use compute services to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud and introduces serverless computing.

## What you will do?

- Create a VM instance using EC2 service.
- Run a simple web server on the VM instance.
- Connect to the VM instance using SSH.
- Adjust security group rules to allow HTTP traffic.
- Create a lambda function to run code without provisioning servers.
